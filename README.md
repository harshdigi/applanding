# TinDog - App Landing

TinDog is a simple static app landing website created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. This project was developed as a way to practice and learn front-end technologies. The website consists of different sections including a header, contact, testimonials, pricing, and footer. Users can download the app by clicking on the "Download" button, which will redirect them to the app store.

## Project Demo

-   HTML: Used for creating the structure and content of the web page.
-   CSS: Used for styling the elements and layout of the web page.
-   JavaScript: Used for adding interactivity and functionality to the website.
-   Bootstrap: Used as a front-end framework for responsive design and pre-built components.

## How It Works

1.  When the website is loaded, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are loaded into the browser.
